# Music Concert Playbill App

This app is designed to function as a digital playbill for music concerts. It provides a platform for concert organizers and attendees to access information about upcoming concerts, including details about the performers, venue, and schedule.

## Built with React.JS and styled-components

The app is built using React.JS, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It utilizes the component-based architecture of React to create reusable UI components, resulting in a modular and efficient codebase. The styling of the app is done using styled-components, a CSS-in-JS library that allows for dynamic styling of React components.

## Libraries Used

The following libraries were used in the development of this project:

- **react-router-dom**: This library enables navigation and routing within the app, allowing for seamless transitions between different sections or pages.
- **styled-components**: This library provides a convenient way to style React components by writing CSS-in-JS. It offers features like component-level styling and dynamic theming.

## Utilizing React Hooks

This project leverages various React hooks to enhance functionality and manage state. The following React hooks were utilized:

- **useContext**: The useContext hook was used to enable the sharing of data and state between different components without the need for prop drilling.
- **useState**: The useState hook was employed to manage and update component-level state within the app, allowing for dynamic changes based on user interactions.
- **useEffect**: The useEffect hook was utilized to handle side effects such as data fetching, allowing for asynchronous operations and lifecycle management within components.

## Prototyped on Figma

The entire project was prototyped using Figma, a popular design tool that allows for collaborative interface design and prototyping. Figma enables designers and developers to create and share interactive mockups, aiding in the visualization and development of the app's user interface.
